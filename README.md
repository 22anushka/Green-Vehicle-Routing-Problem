# Green-Vehicle-Routing-Problem

With rising global pressures and constraints to enforce sustainability and reduce emissions in
heavily polluting sectors like the transportation sector, a green solution is the need of the hour.

The main objective is to find an optimum solution to the extended Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), precisely the Green-VRP
that aims to minimize carbon emissions while tackling the VRP.

The classical VRP deals with the delivery of goods from a depot to a set of customers in various cities. Each vehicle
route must start and end at the depot after visiting all the cities exactly once. The main objective
of VRP is to minimize the total distance or time traveled. There are many variations of VRP
depending on the constraints imposed. The solutions to the GVRP problem must be both scalable and general
enough to adapt as solutions to multi-objective variants of this problem. Thus, the requirement is a
model that would aid in designing the transportation network which targets reducing vehicle
fuel consumption while cutting down on operational costs and achieving performance
indicators like customer satisfaction.
